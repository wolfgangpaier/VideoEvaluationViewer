*) Generate a system level specification MD file for a python tool that offers UI-based visual comparison and viewing of one or more videos.
*) The tool should be implemented in the project subfolder ./visualization.
*) Generate a concise specification document in the subfolder ./specifications/visualization.
	1) mark all specifications that are directly based on this intial requirements document with [REQUIRED]
	2) mark all specifications that can be unambiguously decduced from this requirements document with [DEDUCED]
	3) mark all entries in the specification document the are unclear/ambiguous with [UNCLEAR]

*) The main entry point for the script should be ./visualization/visualize.py
*) Try to structure the code well and generate submodules within ./visualization where it's useful.

*) Requirements for this tool are:
	1) A simplistic UI. Videos should be loaded via drag-and-drop into the window or via the menu.
		a) UI should have a menu with the following entries:
			*) File->Load Videos: Opens a file-dialog that lets the user select 1 or more vieos which are added to the current viewing session.
			*) View->Clear Videos: Unloads all opened videos.
			*) Export: Opens a save file dialog where the user can choose the video-export path and trigger the export function.
		b) The UI should have a scroll bar at the bottom of the window that lets the user choose the current video time. The scroll bar should be controlable by mouse and by left/right keys.
		   Pushing the left/right key should update the video time to the next frame.
		c) The UI-window should be resizable.
		d) By default, videos are displaced side-by-side (1 row).
	2) Viewed videos must have the same framerate, different resolutions should be handled by aspect-ration preserving resize.
	3) Every videos is assigned a video ID starting at 0 for easy referencing.
	3) The UI should have a status bar showing the current video time and frame number.
	4) Every video should have a label, by default it's the video's filename with extension. The video label should be drawn in the top center of the video.
	5) Right click on a video should open a video context menu.
	6) The video context menu should have the following entries and functions:
		a) Set caption: opens text-input window with the current label as default. The user can change the video's label.
		b) Set filter: opens a filter configuration window that lets the user select a filter from a list of available filter. The filter window should have space on the right for configuration UI items, since every filter might have or have not configurable parameters.
		c) Set playback audio: changes the source video ID for audio playback to the current video. This option should be inactive if the video has no audio track.
	7) The tool should have a export function that exports the side-by-side view of all loaded videos
		a) By default the output video should be exported in full-resolution i.e. all videos are upscaled to the maximum resolution of all input videos.
		b) Alternatively, the user should be allowed to specify a specific export resolution where width and hight are automatically recomputed for aspect ration preservation.
		c) Export would also draw the video frame number in the left top corner of the exported video.
	8) CLI-Interaface: all user inputs (video-loading, filter, captioning, ...) as well as the export function should be configurable via CLI.
	9) Visualization filter:
		a) The tool should support filters for improved visualization. For now, we only need a difference heatmap that helps visualizing pixel differences between a video and a reference.
		b) Reference videos, if necessary for a filter, should be selectable from a list in the filter's configuration window. The reference video list contains the video IDs following by ":" and the names of loaded videos.
		c) The filter collection should be easily extendable for future needs.
		
	10) Audio: if one of the source videos has audio then it should be played together with the video and it should remain in sync with the video. Even with frame-by-frame scrolling audio-playback should work.
		a) if multiple input videos have a audio track, then use the video with ID 0 by default as source. The source video ID for audio should be configurable via the right-click context menu.

*) Non-functional requirements are:
	1) Speed: scrolling through the video should be fast.
